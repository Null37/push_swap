Following the recent announcements and curriculum changes we have some important information for you.
Last week 42 Paris announced that they will credit 77 days of blackhole to all their students (only 42 Paris) not applicable to other campuses. For 1337, in contrary to Paris and other campuses who opted for full remote, we opted for a total freeze for all students cursus during the lockdown so that you get a fair chance to progress on your curriculum whether you had an internet connection + laptop or not. 
After reopening the school earlier in October, we added few days to your blackhole so you can work peacefully on your projects. And each month we added some free days to your blackhole to compensate limited working hours in school (curfew etc …). 
The past year has been particularly difficult for all of us, we’re working on getting back on track and we need your help for that as well. 
About the curriculum changes here is an overview on the upcoming changes. 
In order to simplify your common core, the 42 Network has decided to make some changes concerning the following projects. 
=> May 12th :
[UPDATE ] PUSH_SWAP:
Right now we are asking students to create two programs (push_swap and checker). From now on, the checker program is a bonus and no other bonuses are expected.
The validation threshold is now 80%, we are not asking any more for an excellent performance of the algorithm to validate the project, it will be okay with a decent performance on all the different tests. This affects the XP -> 1855!  We have added XP to make the validation at 80% provide the same XP as the previous validation at 100%, this is needed to be at least level 9 at the end of the Common Core.
It will be moved from rank 3 to rank 2.
To subscribe to the projects of rank 3 having validated push_swap is required.
The projects of rank 2 should not be blocked if a student is subscribed to push_swap.
Possible student cases :
If you are doing rank 2: push_swap will appear and you will have to do it.
If you are on rank 3 and have already completed the project: nothing should happen.
If you are on rank 3 and are subscribed to the project: you will not be affected, you can continue working on the project and be evaluated as if nothing had happened.
If you are on rank 3 and haven’t subscribed to push_swap: you can move forward on your cursus without doing it. Contact your staff if you are in this case.
[ REMOVE ] LIBASM:
Removed from the 1st part of the cursus: it will be now available to students once they finish ft_transcendence. We have considered that coding in assembler language is not a basic skill needed nowadays by junior developers. Also, the fact of starting coding in C gives already a good understanding of how code works to move to high-level coding languages.
Possible student cases:
If you are registered: we allow you to unregister and not do the project or, if you prefer it, to be able to work on it, close and evaluate it. If you are already registered, you will not be affected by the change.
If you haven’t registered yet: you don’t have to do the project, can move forward with your cursus.
[ ADD ] INCEPTION:
The new project introduced!! Deals with docker-compose so that the students discover container orchestration.
Introduced on rank 03, next to ft_services.
[ UPDATE ] FT_SERVICES:
Students will have to choose between inception and ft_services. This is the first step towards removing completely this project in the 6th of July. In a week we will have to make ft_services NOT subscribable. (Small reminder: ft_server will also be not subscribable in a week).
The students will still learn the necessary skills to be employable. We chose docker-compose over Kubernetes which is too difficult for a beginner. Kubernetes is a specialized tool that would be more appropriate for a DevOps project in the outer circle.
Specific cases for students:
If you are already registered for the project: you could unregister and register to inception if you want to. Otherwise, you can finish and be evaluated on it before the 6th of July!!
=> May 18th :
netwhat change rank 1 -> 4
add born2beroot (admin sys 101 : VM & OS) rank 1
ft_server & ft_services unsubscribable
=> May 25th :
update cub3d (simpler config file, validation 80%, remove doom bonuses & bmp)
update MiniRT (simpler config file, validation 80%, remove RT bonuses & bmp)
cub3D change rank 2 -> 4
MiniRT change rank 2 -> 4
add intermediate graphic project rank 2 : choice among fdf/fractol/epikong
add intermediate unix project rank 2 : choice among pipex/minitalk
=> June 1st :
netpractice (more interactive network learning tool) replace netwhat
update webserv & ft_irc (rfc reduced to functional subset, stronger focus on multi-client asynchronous networking, validation 80%)
June 8th :
update minishell (less termcaps, validation 90%)
inception change rank 3 -> 5
update philosophers (1/3 of the project goes to bonuses)
philosophers change rank 4 -> 3
=> June 15th :
update transcendance (recenter project on the framework features, guild and tournaments goes to bonuses, validation 80%)
=> June 22nd :
update CPP (validation 80% for each module, 0pt questions are now part of bonuses)
=> June 29th :
update ft_containers (some structures go to bonuses, validation 80%)
=> July 6th :

update gnl (back to original prototype, 1 static var is 80-100%, validation 80%)
update printf (validation 80%, less flags)
ft_services removed
ft_server removed
Reminder : you will be able to complete a project, earn XP, and push the BH, even after changes applied IF YOU REGISTERED to this project BEFORE the changes 
The list is long and the changes, as explained with the dates, will be implemented progressively. If you are in a particular case not listed, please contact us at #bocal channel and explain your situation.
TLDR : We will hold next week a Bocal Standup on zoom to discuss all the upcoming changes and the impact on your cursus.
